     This solving algorithm aims to solve puzzles in the way it is recommended for humans to play, meaning the following:
     - Take one of the equations;
     - Evaluate the left and the right lock - see which of the possible values are still 'available' (for example in a new easy game: 1,2,3);
     - Go through all possible numbers - left or right first doesn't matter - and remove the numbers that are do not work with this equation';
     If all locks have only one possible value left - the code is cracked; which means the algorithm is done. If not, reiterate through the equations again.
     Every iteration through the equation increments the complexity by one.
